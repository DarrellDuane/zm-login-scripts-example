PHP script for utilizing authentication hash to login to ZoneMinder sites. Version 1.0   06/21/2020

This allows you to have a specific domain name on a local server redirect you to your ZoneMinder 
installation and log you in and take you to the function in ZoneMinder you specify.  
You would want to use this in a protected environment behind a firewall or at least NAT.
